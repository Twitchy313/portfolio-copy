    <h3>I do <span>NOT</span> own any of these websites, I rebuilt these websites for web development portfolio purposes.</h3>

                <a href="https://movieswithreact.netlify.app" target="blank"><img src="/images/portfolio_images/React_Movie.png" id="M-A-D"></a>
                <br>
                <p>React Movies is a website that provides information about the newest movies out in theaters, along with information about the film, including Cast, Director, Ratings, etc. The stack used to build the site includes <span>HTML, CSS, and React Js</span>.</p>

                <a href="https://javascriptpong.netlify.app" target="blank"><img src="/images/portfolio_images/js_pong.png"></a>
                <p>A fun portfolio project, the classic game of pong completely built using <span>HTML, CSS and Javascript</span>. Art work designed using Photoshop.</p>

                <a href="https://appleportfolio.netlify.app/" target="blank"><img src="/images/portfolio_images/Apple_copy.png"></a>
                <p>A simple but effective design. Apple has a presence like no other, with not only the architecture of their site, but flawlessly displaying their products. I decided to challenge myself early on when I started learning to program, and this is my small representation of Apple's landing page using responsive design.</p>

                <p>My design background started with Motion Design. Working with Evil Twin Productions, I had the opportunity to work with various record lables and Studios like Capitol Records, Warner Music Group, Paramount Pictures and Disney. I created Motion Graphics, as well as Video and Audio editing for tv spots. Check it out! </p>
